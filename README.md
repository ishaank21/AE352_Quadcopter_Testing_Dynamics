# AE352_Quadcopter_Testing_Dynamics

Jupyter Notebook and Python files that are meant to test the below requirements of a dynamical model for a 6DOF quadcopter.

1.) Hover 1m above ground for 2 minutes.

2.) Fly in a circle of radius 2m, at an altitude of 1m above ground at a speed of 0.5m/s for at least 1 minute.

3.) Launch from ground and ascend vertically until 1m above ground. Move in a straight line 1m above ground at an average speed of 1m/s for 5m, stop (hover), yaw 90 deg to the left, move in another straight line for 5m, stop (hover), land vertically with a speed of no more than 1cm/s.
